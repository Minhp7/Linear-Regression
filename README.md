# Linear regression to predict Men 100m sprint times from 2023-2030

## Assignment 4

## Brief description of Assignment/Project
First, I web scrape wikipedia to get men 100m record times ever since 1964 until the present day. Then I apply a linear regression classification algorithm to predict the times from 2023 until 2030.

## Setup

If using `pyenv` virtual env:

```shell
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Otherwise activate your conda environment.

From your virtual environment:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
